# Auth0 + AWS Seed Projects

These seed projects help you use Auth0 with AWS for applications that you will be developing.

## Running the examples

### Amazon API Gateway
Amazon API Gateway let's you add a layer in front of your existing web services, or implement services using the AWS Lamda, which is a compute service. This example shows how to use Auth0 to add security to those APIs and is intended to be used for a tutorial at <get docs location>. Please follow the instructions there to get up and running.


## What is Auth0?

Auth0 helps you to:

* Add authentication with [multiple authentication sources](https://docs.auth0.com/identityproviders), either social like **Google, Facebook, Microsoft Account, LinkedIn, GitHub, Twitter, Box, Salesforce, amont others**, or enterprise identity systems like **Windows Azure AD, Google Apps, Active Directory, ADFS or any SAML Identity Provider**.
* Add authentication through more traditional **[username/password databases](https://docs.auth0.com/mysql-connection-tutorial)**.
* Add support for **[linking different user accounts](https://docs.auth0.com/link-accounts)** with the same user.
* Support for generating signed [Json Web Tokens](https://docs.auth0.com/jwt) to call your APIs and **flow the user identity** securely.
* Analytics of how, when and where users are logging in.
* Pull data from other sources and add it to the user profile, through [JavaScript rules](https://docs.auth0.com/rules).
